# About us:
We are Project Group 3 in the course DA376DVT21 "Development for the Cloud" at HÃ¶gskolan Kristianstad.  
Our Group consists of:  
Amer Hard: Backend developer  
Abdifatah Abdulkadir Ibrahim: Backend developer  
Jonathan Hoffmann: Frontend developer  
Marija Rankovic: Frontend developer  

This application was initially developed for the course "Web Applications" by Amer Harb, Marija Rankovic and Suzanne Zomer, but was greatly improved during this course.



# Tech:
The website is programmed in 3 major programming languages:  
HTML for the static pages  
JavaScript for all dynamic features  
CSS to make it look nice  

This frontend holds no information, as all instructions are given to the backend server, which also contains the database. This connection is done entirely with the backends HTTP API. This means, that Postman could be a functional substitude.
The little information that is saved is mainly login tokens, so that users can have an active session and don't have to log in for every operation.  
All custom art assests where created by Jonathan Hoffmann with the exception of one gif, that is retrieved from the gif website tenor.
## Color:
The color palet was generated with an online tool called ColorSpace. The generic color gradient from a yellow that was sampled from a physical laundry booking board. https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23B79F35&sub=1  
Background Color: Yellow #b79f35  
Background for text overlays etc.: Lime #749845  
Selected items and buttons: Blue #135F6B  
Borders: Turquoise #2F4858  
Unused colors: pastel dark green #37895D and marine cyan #00756D
